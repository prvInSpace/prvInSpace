- 👋 Hi, I’m Preben Vangberg (@prvInSpace), a language technology PhD student in North Wales.
- 🦊 I mostly use Gitlab for my projects. You can find my Gitlab account at [gitlab.com/prvInSpace](https://gitlab.com/prvInSpace)
- 🧑‍🔧 I once upon a time made the Open Source Dictionary project, which aimed to create an open-source dictionary API for several languages. You can find out more about it at [opensourcedict.org](https://opensourcedict.org).
- 👀 My main area of research is automatic speech recognition (ASR) for minority languages.
- 📫 You can reach me through my email [prv21fgt@bangor.ac.uk](mailto:prv21fgt@bangor.ac.uk)
- 🤸 I don't really use social media, however, I do have a website with links to my various profiles: [prv.cymru](https://prv.cymru)
