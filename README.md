- 👋 Hi, I’m Preben Vangberg (@prvInSpace) and I am a language technology postgraduate located in North Wales.
- 🦊 I mostly use Gitlab for my projects. You can find my Gitlab account at [gitlab.com/prvInSpace](https://gitlab.com/prvInSpace)
- 🧑‍🔧 I am the creator of the Open Source Dictionary project, which aims to create an open source dictionary API for a bunch of languages. You can find out more about it at [opensourcedict.org](https://opensourcedict.org).
- 👀 I’m currently doing a lot of work around speech-to-text modeling for lower resourced languages.
